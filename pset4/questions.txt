0.  BMP: 16M, GIF: 256, JPEG: 16M en PNG:256T (http://www.aivosto.com/vbtips/imageformats.html).
1.  Only GIF (http://www.scantips.com/basics09.html).
2.  Lossless and lossy compression are terms that describe whether or not, in the compression of a file, 
all original data can be recovered when the file is uncompressed. With lossless compression, every single bit of data that was originally in the 
file remains after the file is uncompressed. All of the information is completely restored. (http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/lossless-and-lossy-compression)
3.  JPG (http://www.scantips.com/basics09.html).
4.   First, the system modifies the filename’s first
character in the file’s directory entry to signal that the file
has been deleted and that the directory entry can be recycled.
Second, the system moves all of the file’s FAT clusters
to the hard drive’s list of free clusters. The actual file
data is never touched. (http://cdn.cs50.net/2015/fall/psets/4/garfinkel.pdf)
5.  Overwrite the memory used to store the file.
6.  A library with integer types of a certain width (http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/stdint.h.html).
7.  To show that you want to use the data in a specific way.
8.  A byte is 1 byte, a dword and long 4 bytes and a word 2.
9.  BM (0x4D42).
10. The size of the bitmap file (bf) and the size of the structure (bitmap infoheader) (bi).
11. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB (device independent BMP) with the origin at the upper left corner (https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_(bestandsindeling))(https://msdn.microsoft.com/nl-nl/library/windows/desktop/dd318229(v=vs.85).aspx).
12. biBitCount.
13. fopen will return NULL if it cannot create the outfile to write to.
14. The program is reading in 1 RGB triple at a time.
15. The scanline must be a multiple of 4. If the width is 3, 1 pixel of 3 bytes must be added.
16. Skips over any padding and looks for the next pixel (RGB triple).
17. Current position of the file pointer (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_fseek.htm).
18. Rick Astley.
